My first repository

I know HTML/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, SQL, Ruby, Python, and PHP all through Codecademy. So I know the bulk of 6 or 7 programming languages... but I still don't <i>get</i> how to apply them to make real-world programs.

I've enrolled in Codecademy Ready. I will soon be applying to App Academy. And I have a Technical Consulting job at an Oracle implementation partner. I'm taking the steps to transition myself into programming, including this here now.
